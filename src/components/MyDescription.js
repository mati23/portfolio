            My name is just Mateus. I'm just from a small city of Brazil. I'm just trying to do beautiful things.
            <br />
            Just applying myself everyday just to learn the unknown.

            Just being amazed by this crazy world.
            <br />
            Just sad because I just wish to have all the time just to learn.

            Just happy because I have just everyone that I need in my life.
            <br />
            Just trying to be...
            <br />
            Just someone.
